# TODO
TODO (Dmitry M.) Think about the structure. 
I would like it to be not just a reference book, but a set of ready-made proposals in which solutions can be found according to the description of pain
Example of a workflow that i want to achieve: 
1. I'm looking for how to implement drag and drop from window to window.
2. I open the list of topics.
3. I find a **drag and drop between the tabs**
4. I open up and get to an article about this and how to work with native drag and drop

## ðŸŽ¯ **Optimization options with large amounts of data:**
- Virtualization.
- Progressive rendering.
- Pagination.
- Event delegation. (It also applies to the general concept of optimization, but it can also help well with a large amount of data)
- About problems with dynamic CSS.

## ðŸŽ¯ **BOM (Browser Object Model)**
- `window`
- `navigator`
- `history`
- `location`
- `screen`
- `document`

- `sessionStorage` (It is worth describe about how you can calculate and evaluate `sessionStorage` in an easy way)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Browser API**
- `Worker`
